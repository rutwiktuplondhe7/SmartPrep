# SmartPrep : AI-Powered Interview Preparation Platform

SmartPrep is a full-stack **MERN-based interview preparation platform** that helps users prepare for interviews across **any role or domain** using AI-generated questions, answers, and on-demand concept explanations.

Users can create interview preparation sessions by specifying a role, experience level, focus topics, and goals. Based on this input, the system generates structured Q&A and allows users to explore deeper explanations through AI-powered “Learn More” insights — all within a clean, focused interface.

The platform is designed to support **both technical and non-technical roles**, depending entirely on user input, without enforcing any predefined domain constraints.
